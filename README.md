# About the exercise
The notebook includes importing the feather files, including two machines' inputs. The characteristics of the machines are used to identify a model that fits the machine characteristics into its power consumption. This enables an understanding of the relations between the machines' inputs and power consumption. This characterisation is essential to build optimisation of the second objective of the project. The identified model of Step 1 is used to determine the optimal machine goods per hour with a total of 9,000 GPH with each machine's minimum power consumption. 

* Several modelling techniques are used to compare the best prediction of the power consumption of each machine's type.
* Two optimisation Python libraries are used to complete the second step 
# The code is built with
* Numpy and Pandas libraries
* SkLearn modelling methods
* Gurobi optimisation academic license
* Pulp linear programming optimisation
